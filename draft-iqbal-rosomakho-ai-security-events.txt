                Security Event Framework for AI Systems
            draft-iqbal-rosomakho-ai-security-events-latest

Abstract

   This specification defines a comprehensive security event framework
   for monitoring AI agent systems, including agentic AI workflows,
   autonomous agent architectures, and tool-calling protocols.  While
   motivated by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the framework applies
   broadly to any AI system exhibiting agent-like behaviors, addressing
   critical gaps in traditional security monitoring through standardized
   event taxonomies, correlation schemas, and detection approaches
   specifically designed for AI-mediated data access and semantic
   transformation.  The specification defines five security event
   categories: Discovery, Risk Assessment, Data Access, Policy
   Enforcement, and Semantic Data Lineage.  Event schemas are designed
   as a domain-specific profile that complements existing security event
   standards (CEF, LEEF, OCSF) rather than replacing them, enabling
   integration with existing SIEM infrastructure while providing AI-
   specific semantics.  The framework is protocol-agnostic, supporting
   multiple AI agent frameworks including the Model Context Protocol
   (MCP), LangChain, and others.  It explicitly addresses diverse
   deployment patterns including direct client-server, gateway
   consolidation, embedded AI, autonomous agents, and multi-agent
   orchestration.

1.  Introduction

1.1.  Problem Statement

   AI agent systems introduce autonomous capabilities that transcend
   traditional security monitoring approaches.  These systems invoke
   tools to access enterprise data, transform information semantically
   through large language model processing, maintain conversational
   context across sessions, and operate through protocols designed for
   functionality rather than security observability.

   Existing security frameworks generate events based on file movement,
   network traffic patterns, and process execution.  These approaches
   fail to detect AI-mediated data exfiltration where:

   *  Sensitive data is compressed semantically (500KB document to 2KB
      summary)

   *  Information is aggregated across multiple non-sensitive sources

   *  Data transformations occur within encrypted AI API calls

   *  Context persists across sessions without explicit data transfer

   This specification provides a domain-specific event taxonomy for AI
   agent systems that complements existing security event standards
   (CEF, LEEF, OCSF) by adding AI-specific semantics while maintaining
   interoperability with existing SIEM infrastructure.  Rather than
   replacing existing standards, this framework extends them to address
   unique AI agent security requirements.

1.2.  Critical Security Gaps

   Analysis of production AI agent deployments has identified four
   critical architectural gaps in traditional security systems:

   Gap 1: Visibility Gap. AI capabilities embedded within trusted
   domains bypass inspection.  Production evidence indicates 30-40% of
   AI traffic operates within trusted application contexts, creating
   significant blind spots in security monitoring.

   Gap 2: The Decoupled Transaction Gap. Traditional security logging
   assumes a synchronous, 1:1 relationship between a network session and
   a data transfer (e.g., a single POST request containing a file).
   However, modern AI agent architectures frequently utilize split-
   transaction data transfer workflows to optimize latency and scale.
   In these workflows, the client first negotiates an upload via a
   metadata-only API call (transmitting filename, size, and user
   context), receiving a pre-signed URL or storage token in response.
   The actual binary payload is subsequently transmitted to a distinct
   storage endpoint (often a different domain or CDN) in a separate,
   unauthenticated HTTP session.  Standard logging treats these as two
   unrelated events, resulting in "orphan" data transfers where binary
   content cannot be attributed to the initiating user, session, or
   policy context.

   Gap 3: Governance Gap. Unauthorized AI infrastructure including
   shadow servers, gateways, and agents operates without security
   oversight, creating unmanaged pathways for data access.

   Gap 4: Persistence Gap. Data converted to vector embeddings becomes
   unscannable by traditional DLP systems while retaining complete
   semantic meaning, enabling covert data persistence.

1.3.  Motivating Use Cases

   This event taxonomy enables SOC teams to address concrete security
   scenarios:

   Use Case 1: Shadow AI Detection.  Discover unauthorized AI agents,
   servers, and gateways operating on corporate networks through
   Discovery and Risk events, enabling governance and compliance
   enforcement.

   Use Case 2: Data Exfiltration Detection.  Correlate Data Access and
   Semantic Lineage events to identify when confidential data is
   summarized and sent to unauthorized destinations, detecting
   exfiltration that bypasses traditional DLP.

   Use Case 3: Policy Compliance.  Monitor Policy Enforcement events to
   ensure AI agents respect data classification policies, rate limits,
   and access controls, generating compliance audit trails for
   regulatory requirements.

   Use Case 4: Cross-Border Regulatory Exposure.  Correlate network
   context and regulatory flags in Data Access events to identify when
   sensitive data crosses jurisdictional boundaries through AI agent
   operations, enabling GDPR, data residency, and export control
   compliance monitoring.

1.4.  Scope and Applicability

   This framework applies to:

   *  AI agent protocols: Model Context Protocol, LangChain, AutoGPT,
      OpenAI Assistants API, and custom implementations

   *  Tool-calling systems: Agents that invoke functions, tools, or
      plugins to access data

   *  Deployment patterns: Direct connections, gateway consolidation,
      embedded AI, autonomous agents, and multi-agent orchestration

   *  Environment types: Browser extensions, desktop applications, cloud
      services, edge devices, and containerized infrastructure

   This specification does not cover general AI model training security,
   prompt injection detection, or AI output quality monitoring, which
   are addressed in separate standards.  These domains MAY consume the
   event taxonomy defined here as input signals but are otherwise out of
   scope.

1.5.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119] and
   RFC 8174 [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all capitals,
   as shown here.

1.6.  Terminology

   This specification uses the following terms:

   AI Agent: An autonomous system that uses foundation models to reason,
   make decisions, and invoke tools to accomplish objectives.

   Tool: A capability exposed to an AI agent for accessing resources
   (file access, API calls, database queries).

   Gateway: An intermediary layer consolidating multiple backend servers
   behind a unified endpoint.

   Semantic transformation: AI model processing that changes data
   representation while preserving meaning.

   Semantic lineage: Tracking how sensitive meaning propagates across AI
   transformations.

   Shadow deployment: Unauthorized AI infrastructure operating without
   enterprise security oversight (e.g., personal Claude Desktop clients
   connecting to corporate MCP servers).

2.  Architecture Overview

2.1.  Event Flow Model

   Security events in AI agent systems originate from multiple execution
   points.  A generalized flow encompasses:

   User -> AI agent -> [gateway] -> Tool server -> Resource -> AI model
   -> Output -> Destination

   Each transition point represents a potential security event
   generation surface.  Events flow to security controls (Endpoint, SSE)
   for analysis, correlation, and policy enforcement.

2.1.1.  Split-Transaction Transfer Model

   To accurately log AI data access, the event model MUST account for
   decoupled transfer patterns common in Large Language Model (LLM)
   interactions.  This specification defines the "Split-Transaction"
   model as a sequence where:

   1.  Initiation Event: The agent or user signals intent to transfer
       data.  This event carries the Semantic Context (User ID, Session
       ID, Filename) but lacks the Binary Payload.

   2.  Authorization Event: The service returns a temporary access token
       or pre-signed URI.

   3.  Transfer Event: The payload is transmitted to the authorized URI.
       This event carries the Binary Payload but often lacks the
       Semantic Context (due to the absence of authentication cookies or
       headers on the storage endpoint).

   This taxonomy introduces the correlation_id field (Section 4.1)
   specifically to allow implementations to link the Initiation Event
   with the Transfer Event, even when they traverse different protocols
   or endpoints, ensuring that the semantic meaning of the data remains
   attached to the binary transfer in the security log.

2.2.  Detection Surfaces

   Implementations MAY observe AI agent activity through multiple
   detection surfaces:

   *  Network telemetry: Inline inspection of AI agent protocol traffic

   *  Endpoint telemetry: Process monitoring, file access, configuration
      discovery

   *  Gateway instrumentation: Event generation from consolidation
      layers

   *  Runtime instrumentation: SDK-based event generation within
      applications

   *  Cloud service logging: API logs from AI model providers and SaaS
      platforms

   No single detection surface provides complete visibility.
   Implementations SHOULD combine multiple surfaces for comprehensive
   monitoring.

2.3.  Deployment Pattern Taxonomy

   AI agent systems deploy through five distinct architectural patterns,
   each with unique security characteristics:

2.3.1.  Direct Client-Server Pattern

   AI clients connect directly to individual tool servers.  Detection
   requires monitoring N independent server connections.  Common in
   desktop AI applications connecting to cloud storage APIs.  Security
   characteristic: Distributed detection requirements across multiple
   endpoints.

2.3.2.  Gateway Pattern

   Multiple tool servers consolidated behind a unified gateway endpoint.
   Reduces detection complexity to single observation point.  Common in
   enterprise deployments with centralized AI infrastructure.  Security
   characteristic: Simplified monitoring through consolidation layer.

2.3.3.  Embedded AI Pattern

   AI capabilities integrated within trusted applications.  Traditional
   security boundaries assume trusted environment and skip inspection.
   Production evidence shows 30-40% of AI traffic in this category.
   Security characteristic: Requires endpoint-based detection since
   network inspection is bypassed.

2.3.4.  Autonomous Agent Pattern

   AI systems operating with minimal human supervision.  Extended
   execution timeframes and complex tool chaining.  Common in workflow
   automation and research applications.  Security characteristic: Long-
   running sessions requiring persistent event correlation.

2.3.5.  Multi-Agent Orchestration Pattern

   Multiple AI agents collaborating on complex tasks.  Agent-to-agent
   communication introduces lateral movement concerns.  Emerging in
   advanced enterprise AI deployments.  Security characteristic:
   Requires tracking information flow across agent boundaries.

3.  Event Taxonomy

   This section defines the core event categories that comprise the AI
   agent security monitoring framework.

3.1.  Discovery Events

   Discovery events identify the presence of AI agent infrastructure
   components regardless of authorization status.  These events provide
   the foundation for asset inventory and governance enforcement.

   Event Types: * agent_discovered: AI client or agent detected *
   server_discovered: Tool server endpoint identified *
   gateway_discovered: Consolidation layer detected

   Discovery events MUST include: component_type, protocol_indicators,
   detection_method, confidence_score

3.2.  Risk Assessment Events

   Risk events evaluate discovered components against security policies
   and enterprise governance frameworks.  These events enable
   differentiation between authorized and shadow infrastructure.

   Event Types: * shadow_component_detected: Unauthorized infrastructure
   identified * policy_violation_detected: Component operates outside
   governance framework * risk_score_calculated: Risk assessment
   completed for component

   Risk events MUST include: risk_score, policy_reference,
   authorization_status, remediation_priority

3.3.  Data Access Events

   Data Access events track tool invocations that retrieve, process, or
   transmit enterprise data.  These events enable monitoring of what
   data AI agents access and where it flows.

   Event Types: * tool_invoked: Agent initiated tool execution *
   data_retrieved: Tool returned data to agent * data_transmitted: Data
   sent to external destination

   Data Access events MUST include: tool_name, data_sensitivity,
   access_result, byte_count

3.4.  Policy Enforcement Events

   Policy Enforcement events document security control decisions applied
   to AI agent operations.  These events provide audit trails for
   compliance and enable detection of policy bypass attempts.

   Event Types: * access_allowed: Operation permitted by policy *
   access_denied: Operation blocked by policy * quota_exceeded: Rate
   limit or threshold exceeded

   Policy Enforcement events MUST include: policy_decision,
   enforcement_point, justification, override_status

3.5.  Semantic Data Lineage Events

   Semantic Lineage events track how meaning propagates through AI
   transformations, addressing the unique challenge of semantic data
   exfiltration where traditional content-based monitoring fails.

   Event Types: * semantic_transformation_detected: Data meaning altered
   by AI processing * context_persisted: Information stored in
   conversational memory * meaning_exfiltrated: Semantic content
   transmitted to unauthorized destination

   Semantic Lineage events MUST include: transformation_type,
   meaning_preservation_score, source_data_classification,
   destination_classification

4.  Common Event Schema Elements

   All events in this taxonomy MUST include the following core fields:

4.1.  Event Classification

   *  event_category: Event category, constrained to: discovery,
      risk_assessment, data_access, policy_enforcement, semantic_lineage

   *  event_type: Specific event type within category (e.g.,
      agent_discovered, data_transmitted, meaning_exfiltrated)

4.2.  Correlation Fields

   *  event_id: Unique identifier for this event (UUID format)

   *  correlation_id: Links related events in multi-step operations

   *  parent_event_id: References causative event in chain

   *  session_id: Groups events within single user session

   The correlation_id field specifically addresses the Split-Transaction
   Transfer Model by enabling implementations to link metadata-rich
   initiation events with payload-carrying transfer events.
   Implementations MUST use this field to correlate events across the
   decoupled transaction pattern described in Section 2.1.1.

4.3.  Temporal Fields

   *  timestamp: Event generation time (ISO 8601 format)

   *  event_duration_ms: Operation execution time

   *  detection_latency_ms: Time between occurrence and detection

4.4.  Identity Fields

   *  user_id: Authenticated user identifier

   *  agent_id: AI agent instance identifier

   *  organization_id: Tenant or organization identifier

4.5.  Network Context

   *  source_ip: Origin address

   *  destination_ip: Target address

   *  destination_domain: Target hostname

   *  protocol: Network protocol identifier

4.6.  Data Classification

   *  data_sensitivity: Classification level (public, internal,
      confidential, restricted)

   *  data_categories: Types of data accessed (PII, financial,
      source_code, etc.) - RECOMMENDED for data access events

   *  regulatory_flags: Applicable compliance frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA,
      SOC2, etc.)

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Privacy Protection

   Implementations MUST minimize collection of AI prompt content and
   model responses.  Detection SHOULD rely on metadata analysis (timing
   patterns, payload sizes, endpoint signatures) rather than deep packet
   inspection of conversational content.

5.2.  False Positive Management

   Multi-signal fusion SHOULD be used to achieve high detection
   confidence.  Production validation in Appendix B demonstrates that
   single-signal detection typically achieves only 50-70% confidence,
   while multi-signal correlation (3+ signals) exceeds 95% confidence.
   Implementations SHOULD correlate User-Agent analysis, temporal
   patterns, payload characteristics, and endpoint signatures.  No
   single detection surface provides complete visibility; combining
   multiple surfaces reduces both false positives and false negatives.

5.3.  Evasion Resistance

   Adversaries may attempt to evade detection through: * Protocol
   mimicry: Making AI traffic appear as standard HTTPS * Timing
   manipulation: Introducing artificial delays to avoid burst detection
   * Payload obfuscation: Encrypting or encoding transmitted data

   Implementations SHOULD employ multiple detection surfaces and
   regularly update signatures based on emerging evasion techniques.

5.4.  Encrypted Traffic Handling

   AI agent protocols predominantly use TLS 1.3 encryption.
   Implementations requiring deep inspection MUST implement TLS
   interception with appropriate user consent, certificate management,
   and privacy safeguards.  Metadata-only detection is RECOMMENDED as a
   privacy-preserving alternative.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.  Future versions may define an
   IANA registry for AI security event types and category identifiers.

   Endpoint: /aiserver.v1.filesyncservice/fsuploadfile Method: POST
   User-Agent: Unknown(connect-es/1.6.1) Total: 57,324 bytes (56 KB)

   Traditional DLP Coverage: File-oriented DLP controls did not generate
   violations for these uploads NO file downloads (HTTP GET with file
   MIME types) NO file attachments NO cloud storage sync operations Data
   transmitted in HTTP POST bodies (gRPC-Web serialization) Traditional
   DLP verdict: ALLOWED (saw only "POST -> 200 OK") Reality: 56 KB
   source code uploaded to third-party AI service

   Payload sizes (10-12 KB) and /filesyncservice/fsuploadfile endpoint
   consistent with source code files being transmitted to AI backend.

B.5.  Detection Signature Validation

   Multi-Signal Fusion Results: Single Signal Confidence: ~50-70% Multi-
   Signal (3+) Confidence: >95% Validated Approach: Correlate User-Agent
   + Temporal + Payload + Endpoint patterns

   Telemetry Source Effectiveness (signals marked HIGH achieve >95%
   confidence when combined):

B.6.  Privacy Compliance

   Data Captured (Metadata Only): Byte counts, User-Agent strings, URL
   endpoints, timestamps, TLS characteristics, IP addresses, HTTP status
   codes, protocol identifiers

   Data NOT Captured (Content): No AI prompt content, no AI response
   content, no source code inspected, no variable/function names, no
   semantic meaning from code

   Assessment: COMPLIANT with privacy requirements.  All detection via
   network metadata.  No deep packet inspection of AI prompts/responses
   performed or required.

B.7.  Key Validation Conclusions

   1.  Shadow MCP clients exist in production - Cursor IDE detected
       operating without governance oversight, generating 10.8% of
       observed traffic

   2.  Network telemetry was sufficient in this dataset - 100% detection
       accuracy using User-Agent + timing + endpoints + payloads; no
       cloud API integration required

   3.  Cloud-side governance has no visibility - Zero integration
       detected; Cursor operated independently of enterprise AI control
       planes

   4.  Semantic exposure bypassed file-oriented DLP in this deployment -
       56 KB uploaded via API payloads invisible to file-based DLP
       systems

   5.  Event schemas are implementable - Valid JSON events successfully
       generated from real network transactions

   6.  Privacy can be preserved - Metadata-only detection achieved 100%
       accuracy while protecting user privacy

B.8.  Validation Limitations

   Single organization: Traffic from one enterprise deployment Limited
   duration: 28-minute observation window Known agent type: Cursor IDE;
   other AI agents may exhibit different signatures No false negative
   analysis: Ground truth not available for comparison Geographic
   specificity: United States traffic flows; other regions may differ

   Despite these limitations, validation demonstrates the specification
   addresses an observable, real-world security gap with implementable
   detection methods.
